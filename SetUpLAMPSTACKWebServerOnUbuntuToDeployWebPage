In this I will explain how I went about installing LAMP components and deployed a simple web page to a node machine using ansible scripts. I used Jenkins to create a 
CI/CD pipeline, using GitHub as a repo to store the ansible scripts and the inventory files, I used pipeline scripts to checkout the github repo, run the ansible
playbooks to create the LAMP stack and to deploy the web page
I used AWS to create 2 EC2 instances , one as a master and another as a node

Create two vms on aws
connect to master vm

Install ansible in master
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ansible

press command n in a MAC terminal to clone a terminal 
connect to node vm in this terminal using ssh commands   

In the Master Node terminal
ssh-keygen -t rsa (in the master vm)
enter enter just accept the default filenames and directories
this will give a public key id_rsa.pub ahd private key file id_rsa
Copy the  master vm public key which is .ssh/id_rsa.pub file to the node .ssh/authorized_keys 
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub 
select the whole key and Control C to copy  

Go to the node VM terminal 
rm .ssh/authorized_keys to remove the old key file 
vi .ssh/authorized_keys and press i to insert, Ctrl V to paste the key from Master here and esc :wq to save and quit

Go back to the master VM
configure the localhost and remote hosts etc.
sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
insert press i 
in the beginning add the following
[testservers]
xxx.xx.xx.xx  (Ipaddress of node, to find this go to node and type ifconfig the ip address will be displayed after inet: xxx.xx.xx.xx)
esc :wq to save and quit

Create these three files in the master VM if you are not using jenkins and github other skip and go down to the jenkins installation 

First File : index.html

~              


Second File :Deploy.yml


---
- name: copy
  hosts: testservers
  become: true
  become_user: root
  gather_facts: true
  tasks:
    - name: "copy file"
      copy: src=/home/ubuntu/index.html dest=/var/www/html/index.html
~                                                                               
~                                                                               
~                          


Third File :Lampstack.yml

---
- name: install apache & php & mysql
  hosts: testservers
  become: true
  become_user: root
  gather_facts: true
  tasks:
     - name: "Install apache2"
       package: name=apache2 state=present
     - name: "Install apache2-php5"
       package: name=apache2 state=present
     - name: "Install php-cli"
       package: name=php-cli state=present
     - name: "Install php-mcrypt"
       package: name=php-mcrypt state=present
     - name: "Install php-gd"
       package: name=php-gd state=present
     - name: "Install php-mysql"
       package: name=php-mysql state=present
     - name: "Install php-mysqlserver"
       package: name=php-mysql-server state=present



Use these commands on your master VM
Ansible-playbook lampstack.yml
Go to the node ec2-xx-xxx-xx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com
You will see the apache server page

Use this command to deploy the page
Ansible-playbook deploy.yml
Now you will see the ha ha first web page
Hooray you have deployed your web page 


If using a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline and Github as a repo
On the Master Terminal
Install Jenkins ( use CreatesMasterandSlaveInstancesinAWS/InstallJenkinsInAWSVM as a guide)

Create a pipeline job
Write this script 
Use the pipeline syntax generator to get the code, 
Ansible tool :the name of the ansible you gave in configuration
Playbook file path in workspace:deploy.yml
Inventory file path in workspace:dev.ini
SSH connection credentials:add jenkins
choose ssh username with private key
id:private-key(anyname)
description:deploy(anyname)
username:nalapatt(anyname)
private key choose enter directly
add the aws key you downloaded to create your instance should be in the downloads folder:*.pem file, cat this file
press add and copy and paste
now save and then choose the ssh key you just created
Disable the host SSH key check:check this box 
save and then generate the script , copy this script and paste into the pipeline script



use the github https://github.com/nalapatt/myapp-ansible.git
this contains the dev.ini which has the node server defined (change it to your node VM Ip address), the index.html (which has your web page),
the deploy.yml and the lampstack.yml

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        
        stage('Hello checkout') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello checkout'
                git 'https://github.com/nalapatt/myapp-ansible.git' ( I have the files on this github repo)
            }
        }
        stage('Hello install lamp') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello playbook'
                ansiblePlaybook credentialsId: 'private-key', disableHostKeyChecking: true, installation: 'nansible', inventory: 'dev.ini', playbook: 'lampstack.yml'
            }
        }
        stage('Hello deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello deploy'
                ansiblePlaybook credentialsId: 'private-key', disableHostKeyChecking: true, installation: 'nansible', inventory: 'dev.ini', playbook: 'deploy.yml'
            }
        }
    }
}
